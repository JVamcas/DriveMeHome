# DriveMeHome

**Have you ever driven out with your friends,or alone, for some
entertainment only to find out that you need to drive back home but now
you're intoxicated and run a risk of getting fined or jailed by the
police for drunk driving?**

***

**This is where #DriveMeHome comes in:**

This app helps you to find a driver nearby to drive you home instead

**This app is an incomplete project that has been frozen for now**

### How it works:

1. **The vehicle owner is shown the home page below showing his current location**
