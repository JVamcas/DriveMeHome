# DriveMeHome

**Have you ever driven out with your friends,or alone, for some
entertainment only to find out that you need to drive back home but now
you're intoxicated and run a risk of getting fined or jailed by the
police for drunk driving?**

***

**This is where DriveMeHome comes in:**
***

This app helps you to find a driver nearby to drive you home instead

**This is an incomplete project that has been frozen for now**

### How it works:

1.  **The vehicle owner is shown the home page below showing his current location**

1.  **Vehicle owner set up his trip on the app**
